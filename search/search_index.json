The system is designed to be simple, secure, and role-based, ensuring that each user\u2019s data remains private and manageable. The project focuses on clean data modeling, authentication, and modular backend design using Django and Django REST Framework. Problem Statement Gamers often play multiple games across platforms and struggle to keep track of their progress, playtime, and completion status. Existing platforms are either public, overly complex, or include unnecessary social features. There is a need for a private, API-driven system where users can securely manage their personal gaming library. Objectives Provide a secure authentication system using JWT Maintain a centralized game catalog Allow users to track personal game progress Enforce role-based access control Scope of the Project User registration and authentication (JWT) Role-based access control (Admin, Gamer) Game catalog management Personal game progress tracking CRUD APIs for all core entities User Roles and Permissions Admin Create and manage games in the catalog Manage genres and platforms Approve or reject game addition requests Gamer View the game catalog Add games to personal library Track progress (Wishlist, Playing, Completed, Dropped) Update hours played and personal rating Each gamer can only access their own data . Technology Stack Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework Authentication: JWT (Access & Refresh tokens) Database: PostgreSQL ORM: Django ORM Module Breakdown Users Module Custom user model based on AbstractUser Authentication and authorization logic Game Catalog Module Stores all available games Maintains genres and platforms Managed primarily by admin users Progress Module Maps users to games Tracks status, hours played, rating, and notes Represents the user\u2019s personal game library Game Requests Module Allows gamers to request addition of new games to the catalog Stores pending game requests submitted by users Enables admins to approve or reject requests Acts as a controlled entry point to the game catalog Database Design The database follows a normalized relational design separating global catalog data from user-specific data. Entities Users Stores application users (admins and gamers) Each user belongs to exactly one role Supports soft deletion for auditability Role is enum - admin or gamer Games Centralized game catalog Independent of users Can belong to multiple genres and platforms Genres Lookup table for game genres Prevents duplication and magic strings Platforms Lookup table for supported platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox, etc.) Game_Requests Stores game addition requests submitted by gamers Each request is linked to the requesting user Requests can be approved or rejected by admins Approved requests result in a new game being added to the catalog User_Games Associative entity between users and games Stores user-specific metadata: Status Hours played Personal rating Notes Completion timestamp Indexes & Constraints users.email - UNIQUE users.username - UNIQUE genres.name - UNIQUE platforms.name - UNIQUE user_games (user_id, game_id) - UNIQUE (prevents duplicate entries) game_requests (requested_by, game_title) - UNIQUE Foreign key constraints enforced across all relations Enum validation for game status at application level API Design Base Configuration Base URL: /api/v1/ API Versioning: URI-based ( v1 ) Authentication: JWT (Access & Refresh tokens) Pagination: Applied to all list endpoints Default page size: 10 Update Strategy: PATCH used for partial updates PUT is not used Filtering & Query Parameters Filtering is supported on list endpoints where applicable. Multiple filter values are supported using comma-separated parameters. Games Supported filters: name (partial match) genre (comma-separated) platform (comma-separated) release_date_from release_date_to Example: GET /games?genre=rpg,fps&platform=pc,ps5&release_date_from=2020-01-01 User-Games Supported filters: status platform rating hours_played Authentication APIs Endpoint Method Description /auth/register POST Register new gamer /auth/login POST Authenticate user /auth/refresh POST Refresh access token /auth/logout POST Logout user Registration assigns the gamer role by default . Role cannot be chosen by the client. Admin User Management APIs Endpoint Method Description /admin/users GET List all users /admin/users/{id} GET Get user details /admin/users/{id} PATCH Update user /admin/users/{id} DELETE Soft delete user Authenticated User APIs Endpoint Method Description /users/me GET Get own profile /users/me PATCH Update own profile /users/me/change-password POST Change password /users/me DELETE Delete own account (soft delete) Game Catalog APIs Endpoint Method Access Description /games GET All List games /games POST Admin Add game /games/{id} GET All Get game /games/{id} PATCH Admin Update game Deletion of games is not supported to preserve data integrity. Genre APIs Endpoint Method Access Description /genres GET All List genres /genres POST Admin Add genre /genres/{id} GET Admin Get genre /genres/{id} PATCH Admin Update genre Platform APIs Endpoint Method Access Description /platforms GET All List platforms /platforms POST Admin Add platform /platforms/{id} GET Admin Get platform /platforms/{id} PATCH Admin Update platform User-Game APIs Endpoint Method Access Description /user-games GET Gamer List personal games /user-games POST Gamer Add game /user-games/{id} GET Gamer Get entry /user-games/{id} PATCH Gamer Update progress /user-games/{id} DELETE Gamer Remove game Admin users may have read-only access for moderation or support purposes. Game Request APIs Endpoint Method Description /game-requests POST Submit a game addition request /game-requests GET List game requests /game-requests/{id} GET Retrieve a game request /game-requests/{id} PATCH Update request status (admin only) Gamers can only view their own requests, admins can view all. Status updates are restricted to admins, gamers have read-only access to status. Notes All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes Object-level permissions ensure users only access their own data Soft deletion is used for users and system entities Hard deletion is allowed only for user-owned progress data Authentication & Authorization Strategy JWT-based authentication Access tokens are short-lived, refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens Role-based permission checks Object-level permissions to ensure users can only access their own data Conclusion GamerHouse is designed as a secure, modular, and scalable backend system for personal game tracking. The project emphasizes real-world backend engineering principles such as normalized data modeling, role-based access control, and clean API design, making it a strong intern-level backend project.","title":"GamerHouse \u2013 Technical Document"},{"location":"#gamerhouse-technical-document","text":"","title":"GamerHouse \u2013 Technical Document"},{"location":"#project-overview","text":"GamerHouse is a REST-based backend system that allows gamers to privately track their gaming activity , including games they are playing, wish to play, or have completed.
